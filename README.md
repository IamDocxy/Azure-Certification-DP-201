# Azure-Certification-DP-201: Designing an Azure Data Solution
Road to Azure Data Engineer Part-II

## Exam Pattern

<img src="images/1.Exam-Pattern.jpg">

### 1. Design Azure Data Storage Solutions (40-45%)

- Recommend an Azure data storage solution based on requiremnets

  - choose the correct data storage solution to meet the technical and business requirements
  - choose the partition distribution type

- Design non-relational cloud data stores

  - design data distribution and partitions
  - design for scale (including multi-region, latency, and throughput)
  - design a solution that uses CosDB, Data Lake Storage Gen2, or Blob storage
  - select the appropriate Cosmos DB API
  - design a disaster recovery strategy
  - design for high availability

- Design relational cloud data stores

  - design data distribution and partitions
  - design for scale (including multi-region, latency,throughput)
  - design a solution that uses SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics
  - design a disaster recovery strategy
  - design for high availability

### 2. Design Data Processing Solutions (25-30%)

- Design batch processing solutions

  - design batch processing solutions that use Data Factory and Azure Databricks.
  - identify the optimal data ingestion method for a batch processing solution
  - identify where processing should take place, such as at the source, at the destination, or in transit
  - identify transformation logic to be used in the Mapping Data Flow in Azure Data Factory

- Design real-time processing solutions

  - Design for real-time processing by using Stream Analytics and Azure Databricks
  - design and provision compute resources

### 3. Design for Data Security and Compliance (25-30%)

- Design security for source data access

  - plan for secure endpoints (private/public)
  - choose the appropriate authentication mechanism, such as access keys, shared access signatures (SAS), and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

- Design security for data policies and standards

  - design data encryption for data at rest and in transit
  - design for data auditing and data masking
  - design for data privacy and data classification
  - design a data retention policy
  - plan an archiving strategy
  - plan to purge data based on business requirements


## Azure Storage

### BLOB

- It is also a backbone for creating a storage account that can be used as a Data Lake storage

### CosmosDB

- Globally distributed and elstically scalable database.

#### i) Core (SQL) API

- Default API for Azure Cosmos DB
- Can query heirarchical JSON documents with a SQL-like language
- Uses Javascript's type system, expression evaluation, and function invocation.

#### ii) MongoDB API

- Allows existing MongoDB client SDKs, drivers, and tools to interact with the data transparently, as if they are running against an actual MongoDB database.
- Data is stored in document format, similar to Core (SQL)

#### iii) Cassandra API

- Using Cassandra Query language (CQL), the data will appear to be a partitioned row store.

#### iv) Table API

- The original table API only allows for indexing on the partition and row keys; there are no secondary indexes.
- Storing table data in Cosmos DB automatically indexes all the properties, requires no index management.
- Querying is accomplished by using OData and LINQ queries in code, and the original REST API for GET operations.

#### v) Gremlin API

- Provides a graph based view over the data. Remember that at the lowest level, all data in any Azure Cosmos DB is stored in an ARS format.
- Use a traversal language to query a graph database, and Azure Cosmos DB supports Apache Tinkepop's Gremlin language.

## Scenario's to choose different CosmosDB API's

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<img src="images/7.MongoDB-Usecase.jpg">

    - We are not looking into any relationships so Gremlin is not the right choice
    - Other CosmosDB API's are not used since the existing queries are MongoDB native and there MongoDB is the best fit

## Request Unit Considerations for CosmosDB

- Item size
- Item indexing
- Item property count
- Indexed properties
- Data consistency
- Query patterns
- Script usage

## CosmosDB Partition Design

- Items are placed into logical partitions by partition key
- Partition keys should generally be based on unique values
- Ideally the partition key should be part of a query to prevent "fan out"
- Logical partitions are mapped to physiccal partitions
- A physical partition always contains atleast one logical partition
- Physical partitions are capped at 10GB
- As physical partitions fill-up they will seamlessly split
- Logical partitions can not be split
